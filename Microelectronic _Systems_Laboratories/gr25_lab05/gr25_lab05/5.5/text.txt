The low leakage gates are designed for a low power consumption, as the plot and measures shown the peak currents are lower than the HS gates currents, on the other
hand the speed decreases, since the current for charging and discharging the capacitance load is lower, it requieres more time(as the measures tell us the delay 
time are higher for LL than for HS)
